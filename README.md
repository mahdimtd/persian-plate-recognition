## Persian License Plate Recognition System
This project implements a complete pipeline for detecting vehicles, recognizing license plates, and reading Persian license plate numbers from video footage. It combines three custom-trained deep learning models for vehicle detection, license plate detection, and Persian character recognition.


## Key Features :

✅​ Vehicle Detection: YOLOv8 model fine-tuned for vehicle detection

✅​ License Plate Detection: Custom YOLOv8 model for license plate localization

✅​ Persian OCR: CRNN model specialized for Persian license plate recognition

✅​ Object Tracking: ByteTrack for consistent vehicle tracking across frames

✅​ Data Interpolation: Smooths bounding boxes for better visualization

✅​ Video Processing: Processes input videos and generates annotated output

✅​ Persian Text Rendering: Proper bidirectional text support for Persian characters
